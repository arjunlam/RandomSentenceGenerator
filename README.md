RandomSentenceGenerator
=======================

This program generates sentences randomly. Even though the sentences are generated randomly the goal is to have the program use the proper grammer rules to produce them. The program will use a finite state machine (FSM) with the randomly selected words as input and depending on the type of word that is the input the FSM will select the proper next word list to choose a word from. There are different word type files (list of nouns file, list of verbs file, etc) and an initial word will be choosen at random. The first word will be used as the input to the FSM to the program can choose words that are random yet still adhere to proper grammer rules. This program is written in python as an exercise to learn basic python and learn how to implement finite state machines in python.
